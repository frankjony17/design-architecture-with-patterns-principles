# Design Architecture with Patterns & Principles

**Design Architecture for Microservices and Monolithic Solutions, using Design Patterns, Principles 
and the Best Practices.** We will use the right architecture design patterns and techniques.

## What's Including In This Repository
We will start the basics of software architecture with designing e-commerce monolithic architecture that handles low amount of requests.

After that step by step evolves the architecture with
* Layered Architecture
* SOA
* Microservices
* and lastly Event Driven Microservices Architectures
with designing together that handle millions of requests.

We will discuss microservices architectures with all aspects,
* Microservices Decomposition
* Microservices Communications (Sync / Async Message-Based Communication, API Gws)
* Microservices Data Management (Databases / Query / Commands / Distributed Transactions)
* Microservices Distributed Caching
* Microservices Deployments with Containers and Orchestrators
with applying microservices design patterns and practices.

We are going to design with together and step by step with our drawing tool that we will use this designing architectures.
We will start with designing Monolithic Architecture. And you can see that we have **Functional and Non-functional requirements** that should cover our design and we have patterns and principles toolbox that we will learn and use these principles when evolving architectures.
You will find that we will add new requirements in order to **handle millions of request and learn new patterns and practices** that will use these principles when evolving architectures.
* Layered Architecture
* SOA
* Microservices Architectures
* Microservices Architectures API Gws
* Microservices Architectures API Gws — BFF
* Microservices Architecture — Service Aggregator / Registry Patterns
* Microservices Architecture — Message Broker
* Microservices Architecture — Database Sharding Cassandra
* Event-Driven Microservices Architecture
* Microservices Distributed Caching
* Microservices Containers and Orchestrators

We will see full of **patterns and principle toolbox** is loading with new patterns and apply them into current designs. 
We will see the latest patterns that we use more than **30 patterns and practices** with implementing **High scalability, High availability and handle millions of request requirements**.
